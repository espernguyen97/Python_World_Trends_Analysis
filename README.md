3. What are the task given?: 

Through the data given, I'm looking for:

Task 1: A  scatterplot illustrating Birth Rate and Internet Usage statistics by Country.

The scatterplot need to be categorised by Countries’ Income Groups

Task 2:

A scatterplot depicting Life Expectancy (y-axis) and Fertility Rate (x-axis) statistics by Country.

The scatterplot need to be categrorised by Countries Regions.

Task 3:

A visualization based off the data for 2 years: 1960 and 2013.
