1. About the data: 

The data 

3. What are the task given?: 

Through the data given, I'm looking for:

Task 1: A  scatterplot illustrating Birth Rate and Internet Usage statistics by Country.

The scatterplot need to be categorised by Countries’ Income Groups

Task 2:

A scatterplot depicting Life Expectancy (y-axis) and Fertility Rate (x-axis) statistics by Country.

The scatterplot need to be categrorised by Countries Regions.

Task 3:

A visualization based off the data for 2 years: 1960 and 2013.

Some data has been provided in a CSV file, some in Python lists. The CSV file contains combined data for both years. All data manipulations have to be performed in Python (not in Excel) because this project can be audited at the later stage.

Task 4: An insights into how the periods compare.
