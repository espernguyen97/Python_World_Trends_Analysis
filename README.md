World Trends Analysis Project
<br>
<br>
1. About the data: 

The project provided by SuperDataScience. The dataset contains the data of 196 Countries along with their Country Code, 	Birth rate,	 Internet users, 	Income Group. Some data has been provided in a CSV file, some in Python lists. The CSV file contains combined data for both years 1960 and 2013. 

2. Goal: 

Using Python to perform data manipulation and analyze the world trends in different time periods based off the historical data given.

3. What are the task given?: 

Through the data given, I'm looking for:

Task 1: A  scatterplot illustrating Birth Rate and Internet Usage statistics by Country.

The scatterplot need to be categorised by Countries’ Income Groups

Task 2:

A scatterplot depicting Life Expectancy (y-axis) and Fertility Rate (x-axis) statistics by Country.

The scatterplot need to be categrorised by Countries Regions.

Task 3:

A visualization based off the data for 2 years: 1960 and 2013. The data is provided for 2 years: 1960 and 2013 and there's a need to produce a visualisation for each of these years.


Task 4: 

An insights into how the periods compare.

Task 4: Conclusion:

In the 60s, Europe and America had very lower birth rates but higher Life Expectancy than other countries. Life Expectancy for some countries were really low during this period. In 2013, the pattern shared by countries is quite similar with that in the 60s but the overall life expectancy increase sharply compared to the year 1960 .
